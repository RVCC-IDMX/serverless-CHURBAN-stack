# Chrban Serverless Functions Repo:

âœ… [Check out my YouTube Channel with all of my tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

Description of my Repo: 

Taking place in my project is the following: The JavaScript lines of code are serverless functions that utilize continous deployment within GitHub and then allowing it to be placed on Netlify where the site runs with no issues whatsoever. The netlify link works very simply, there is a main.js file and it is exucuted and is then run though with lines such as random dad generator. The random line generator makes it so that there is a random joke displayed on the screen every 10 seconds. The 10 seconds of code comes from the netlify.toml file. There is also a nice photo of a city landscape behind the jokes being displayed within the screen limitation.
